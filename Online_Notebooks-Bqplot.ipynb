    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "Create a repository and name it, e.g. \"Sharing-Notebooks-Online\". If you'd like a different name, feel free to name it something else; just keep in mind that we will use this repo name in later parts of the tutorial. Make sure that you select the checkbox **\"Initialize this repository with a README\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3 (only necessary if you will use the Option 2: Stand alone webpage)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 4\n",

    "\n",
    "bqplot\n",

    "#### Step 5\n",
    "Copy the URL of the repository that you just created on GitHub and go to https://mybinder.org\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6\n",
